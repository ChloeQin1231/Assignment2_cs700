# UDP Assignment2

## Overview of the Assignment

The UDPPingerClient is a simple UDP client program written in Python that sends ping requests to a specified server and displays the response along with the Round Trip Time (RTT). 
This client mimics the standard ping utility but uses the UDP protocol instead of ICMP.

## Instructions

To run the UDPPingerClient program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program files.
3. Run the server-side program.
4. Run the client-side program.

### Dependencies

This program does not require any external libraries to run. It uses Python's standard library, specifically the `socket` module, which is included in the standard Python installation.
